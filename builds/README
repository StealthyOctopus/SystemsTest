SystemsTest README

To run the SystemsTest.jar, the following command must be executed from within the same directory as the "SystemsTest.jar" and configs folders:

java -jar SystemsTest.jar

At present it is not possible to specify the directory to load the configs from, hence them being in the same directory before launching.

This has been tested under linux and requires java 11.
