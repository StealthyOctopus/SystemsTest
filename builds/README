SystemsTest README

To run the SystemsTest.jar you must execute the following command from within the same directory as the "SystemsTest.jar" and configs folders:

java -jar SystemsTest.jar

At present it is not possible to specify the directory to load the configs from, hence being in the same directory before launching.

This has been tested under linux and requireds java 11.
