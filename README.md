# SystemsTest

A high-level framework for managing power across multiple systems in a fictional spaceship.
This project is a "for fun" project and a test bed for exploring ideas relating to managing systems on a fictional craft.

The purpose of this project is to create the various systems you might have on a spaceship and to test how these systems interact, forming a basis for a space ship management game, heavily inspired by Elite Dangerous.

This is done as an exercise only.

Note: the UI layouts and design is currently very basic and needs a lot of work

Goals/To do

-Create more "systems" once the framework has been set up to allow a system to run, in this case, draw power and perform functions
-Add more detail to systems
-Create a user interface to allow systems to be added and removed by a user at runtime
-Load configurations for various models from disk (partially complete, basic XML configs have been added)
