# SystemsTest

A high-level framework for managing power across multiple systems in a fictional spaceship.

The purpose of this project is to create the various systems you might have on a spaceship and to test how these systems interact, forming a basis for a space game.
This is done as an exercise to test out how systems will interact if this were to be made into a game

Goals/To do

-Create more "systems" once the framework has been set up to allow a system to run, in this case, draw power and perform functions
-Add more detail to systems
-Create a user interface to allow systems to be added and removed by a user at runtime
-Load configurations for various models from disk
